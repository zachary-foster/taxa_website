## Jargon glossary

Here are the ways we will use some terms in this vignette:

* **rank**: A taxonomic rank like "family", "genus", or "species". 
* **taxon**: A single taxon at a single rank. e.g. the genus *Homo*.
* **classificaiton**: Multiple taxa at different ranks that nest within each other. e.g. "Mammalia, Primates, Hominidae, Homo, sapiens"
* **observation**: Something associated with a taxon or classification. e.g. an abundance. 
* **regular expression**: Also known as a "regex". This is a standard, well-known, and powerful way of encoding patterns in text.
* **capture groups**: A concept in regular expressions. These are parts of a regex (i.e. a pattern in text) defined by parentheses. For example the following regex has two capture groups: `(.+) some text (.+) some more`. The parentheses do not affect the pattern matched, only specify areas of interested that can be extracted later. 

## Which class to use

`Taxa` has many classes for storing taxonomic information and some types of information could be stored by multiple classes.
Which class to use will depend on what you want to do with the data and your preference.
The following list should help decide which class is the best for your needs. 

* If you are interested in data (e.g. an abundance matrix) assigned to a taxonomic hierarchy, use the `taxmap` class.
* If you are interested in a whole taxonomic tree, but not necessarily any non-taxonomic data, Use the `taxonomy` class. 
* If you are interested in independent classifications of taxa, but not necessarily the "taxonomy" as a whole, use the `hierarchy` and `hierarchies` classes.
* If you are interested in individual taxa at any rank (e.g. The genus *Homo* or the domain Bacteria), but not necessarily the relationships between them: use the `taxon` and `taxa` classes.

Each of the above options has a section below for how to create these objects from external data.

## Creating `taxmap` objects

When non-taxonomic data is your focus, but you want it classified by a taxonomy, then `taxmap` is the class to use. 
The `taxmap` class stores a taxonomic tree (i.e. hierarchy) and any number of user-defined data sets mapped to taxa in that tree.
By "dataset", we mean a list, vector, or table with elements associated with taxa.

Data can come in diverse formats and from diverse sources, so we have made our data import functions as flexible as possible.
However, this flexibility can be overwhelming to new users, so we have made a figure to help you get started: 


```{r, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("parsing_guide.png")
```

To figure out how to parse your data, identify the source of taxonomic data you have (e.g. classification, taxon name, taxon ID, or sequence ID) and then the way it is currently formatted (e.g. in a table) and use the figure above to provide a starting point for how to import it into a `taxmap` object.
The following sections go into detail on how to deal with specific issues.

### Considerations when importing classifications

The most common and most convenient (because no internet querying is needed) way of encoding the taxonomic information is a classification.
This section relates to classifications stored in tables or on their own; for classifications embedded in a string (e.g. a FASTA header), read this section and the section on embedded data that follows.

#### Basics

Lets say my data is about some organisms I know: 

```{r}
organism <- c("Scott", "Shasta", "Yoda")
relation <- c("Colleague", "My cat", "My dog")
```

And I also have classifications for the taxa they are: 

```{r}
org_class <- c("Animalia;Mammalia;Carnivora;Hominidae;Homo;sapiens",
               "Animalia;Mammalia;Carnivora;Felidae;Felis;silvestris",
               "Animalia;Mammalia;Carnivora;Canidae;Canis;lupus")
```

The goal here is to convert this data into the `taxmap` format so that the data is mapped to the taxonomy that is implied in the classifications.
For now, lets just focus on the classifications; we will get back to the rest of the data later. 
We can read in just the classifications like so:

```{r}
library(taxa)
obj <- parse_tax_data(org_class, class_sep = ";")
```

In a `taxmap` object, each input is mapped to exactly one taxon, although multiple elements can be mapped to the same taxon.
However, there are multiple taxa in the classification in each input, so how is this information preserved?
In summary, what `parse_tax_data` does is: 

1. Identify every unique "path" from roots ("Animalia" in this example) to any other taxon. These "paths" are like subclassifcations.  For example "Animalia;Mammalia" and "Animalia;Mammalia;Carnivora" are both unique "paths". That way, the same name can be used for different taxa. For example "Animalia;Mammalia;Carnivora;Canidae;unknown" is a different path than "Animalia;Mammalia;Carnivora;Felidae;unknown" even though the names of both taxa are "unknown".
2. Assign each path an unique ID. This is the "taxon ID" you will be hearing a lot about. For example "Animalia;Mammalia" is the path for "Mammalia" and will have a unique ID. Likewise "Animalia;Mammalia;Carnivora" is the path for "Carnivora" and will have a different ID.
3. Create a tree structure by recording all "parent-child" relationships between taxa (i.e. paths). For example, if "Animalia;Mammalia" gets taxon ID "a" and "Animalia;Mammalia;Carnivora" gets taxon ID "b", then the parent-child relationship stored is "a -> b". A tree is then simply a list of these relationships (internally stored as a table. Try entering `obj$edge_list` to see it).
4. Assign the input data to these newly-created taxon IDs and add it to the `obj$data` list. Input data will be assigned to the "tips" or "leaves" of the tree. For example, the input "Animalia;Mammalia;Carnivora;Hominidae;Homo;sapiens" will be assigned to the unique ID for "sapiens", but all the other taxa in that classification will also get IDs and the parent-child relationships between these IDs will be included. Since "sapiens" is a subtaxon of Animalia, Mammalia, Carnivora, Hominidae, and Homo, the input is implicitly associated with those taxa as well.

Note how the output of `parse_tax_data` contains the input data (stored as "tax_data") named by taxon IDs:

```{r}
print(obj)
print(obj$data$tax_data)
```

While each input is assigned to the leaves "sapiens", "silvestris", and "lupus", the stored tree structure means that they are implicitly assigned to every supertaxa as well. 
We can see the indexes of items are under each taxon using the `obs` function:

```{r}
obs(obj, "tax_data")
```

Note how all of the inputs are implicitly assigned to taxon `"b"` (Animalia), even though in the table they are expcility assigned to the IDs for "sapiens", "silvestris", and "lupus".
You can see why this is by using the `subtaxa` function, which returns the all of the subtaxa encompassed by each taxon:

```{r}
subtaxa(obj, value = "taxon_names")
```

Another way to look at this is using the `supertaxa` function for the IDs assigned to the input.

```{r}
supertaxa(obj, subset = names(obj$data$tax_data), value = "taxon_names")
```

Now that we have covered the basics of how classifications are imported, lets bring some associated data along for the ride.
We can combine our data of interest in a table like so: 

```{r}
my_data <- data.frame(stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
                      organism = organism,
                      relation = relation,
                      org_class = org_class)
print(my_data)
```

Consulting the figure above, we can see this is an example of row 1 column 2: data stored in a table with classifications.
There for, we use the `parse_tax_data` function with the following settings:

```{r}
obj <- parse_tax_data(my_data, class_cols = "org_class", class_sep = ";")
print(obj)
```

Our input table is preserved as `obj$data$tax_data`, but not has an additional column with taxon IDs. 

```{r}
print(obj$data$tax_data)
```


#### Classifications over multiple columns

Instead of a single column, you might have multiple columns, one for each rank, like so:

```{r}
library(tidyr)
my_ranks <- c("kingdom", "class", "Order", "family", "genus", "species")
my_data <- separate(my_data,
                    col = org_class,
                    into = my_ranks,
                    sep = ";")
print(my_data)
```

In that case, you simply specify multiple columns:

```{r}
obj <- parse_tax_data(my_data, class_cols = my_ranks)
print(obj)
```


You can also have a mixture of classifications and single rank columns:

```{r}
my_data <-  unite(my_data, col = "binomial", genus, species, sep = " ")
my_data <-  unite(my_data, col = "classification", kingdom, class,  Order, family, sep = ";")
print(my_data)
```
 
Then you define multiple columns and a separator and the separator is applied to each column:

```{r}
obj <- parse_tax_data(my_data,
                      class_cols = 3:4, # column indexes
                      class_sep = ";")
print(obj)
```

Note that the binomial is now interpreted as a single taxon.
This is because it has a space instead of `";"`.
To split that up as well, we need to get more into how separators are used.

#### Different seperators

`";"` is the most common separator, but others can be used.
In fact, multiple can be used at once.
For example, to split the binomial in the above data:

```{r}
obj <- parse_tax_data(my_data,
                      class_cols = 3:4, # column indexes
                      class_sep = c(";", " "))
print(obj)
```

Separators can also be regular expressions, so this would do the same thing:

```{r}
obj <- parse_tax_data(my_data,
                      class_cols = 3:4, # column indexes
                      class_sep = "[ ;]+", # matches " " or ";" one or more times
                      sep_is_regex = TRUE)
print(obj)
```

You can even use multiple regular expression separators if your data has a truly unfortunate format.


#### Classifications with taxon data (e.g. ranks)

There is often information associated with each taxon in each classification (e.g. ranks) and this data is also of interest:

```{r}
my_data <- data.frame(stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
                      organism = organism,
                      relation = relation,
                      org_class = sapply(strsplit(org_class, ";"),
                                         paste0, "__", my_ranks, collapse = ";"))
print(my_data)
```

Its important to keep in mind there are two kinds of information here:

1. data associated with taxa (e.g. ranks)
2. data associated with inputs (e.g. organisms)

Importing this kind of data takes a basic understanding of regular expressions.
The idea is to define a regular expression with capture groups for each piece of information you want.
Then a corresponding "key" is used to identify what each piece of information is and how you want it named in the output.
In this case:

```{r}
obj <- parse_tax_data(my_data,
                      class_cols = "org_class", 
                      class_sep = ";",
                      class_regex = "(.+)__(.+)",
                      class_key = c(my_name = "taxon_name", my_rank = "info"))
print(obj)
```

Note that there are now two tables in `obj$data`: one for per-input data and one for per-taxon data.
The names supplied to `class_key` are used to name the output columns and the values indicate that the first piece of information is a taxon name and the second is a arbitrary piece of information we want to preserve.
we can also tell it that it is rank information like so:

```{r}
obj <- parse_tax_data(my_data,
                      class_cols = "org_class", 
                      class_sep = ";",
                      class_regex = "(.+)__(.+)",
                      class_key = c(my_name = "taxon_name", my_rank = "taxon_rank"))
print(obj)
```

The only difference with using `"taxon_rank"` instead of `"info"` is that the ranks of each taxon are now accessible by:

```{r}
obj$taxon_ranks()
```

You also can simply ignore the rank info:

```{r}
obj <- parse_tax_data(my_data,
                      class_cols = "org_class", 
                      class_sep = ";",
                      class_regex = "(.+)__.+")
print(obj)
```


#### Classifications without separators

You might find yourself in the unfortunate position of not having consistent separators.
You might be able to use multiple separators or regular expression separators in this case, but you can also ditch the separator entirely and make each taxon be defined be each "match" of a regular expression

```{r}
obj <- parse_tax_data("My mom told me that Mammalia is a class, Carnivora is an order, and Homo is a genus",
                      class_sep = NULL,
                      class_regex = "([a-zA-Z]+) is an? ([a-zA-Z]+)",
                      class_key = c(my_name = "taxon_name", my_rank = "taxon_rank"))
print(obj)
```

Hopefully your data is not encoded this way. 

#### Classifications with info (e.g. ranks) mixed in using a single sep

A few formats have the ranks mixed in with the taxon names, but use a single separator like so:

```{r}
my_data$org_class <- gsub(pattern = "__", replacement = ";", my_data$org_class)
print(my_data)
```

This is an unfortunate format, but it can be dealt with using the logic in the last example.
Instead of using the separator, we can use multiple matches to a regular expression to define each taxon like so:

```{r}
obj <- parse_tax_data(my_data,
                      class_sep = NULL,
                      class_cols = "org_class", 
                      class_regex = "(.+?);(.*?)(?:;|$)",
                      class_key = c(my_name = "taxon_name",
                                    my_rank = "info"))
print(obj)
```

### Importing data with taxon names

If only have a taxon name (e.g. "Homo") instead of the entire classification (e.g. "Mammalia, Primates, Hominidae, Homo"), you can use `lookup_tax_data` to download the full classification from the internet.
This involves querying a database with taxonomy information to look up the classification.
Different databases will return different classifications for the same taxon name.
The default is NCBI, but the Integrate Taxonomic Information Service (ITIS) is also typically a good choice. (scott, do you have anything to add here?)
Lets say we have the following data: 

```{r}
my_tax_name <- c("Homo sapiens", "Felis silvestris", "Canis lupus")
my_data <- data.frame(stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
                      organism = organism,
                      relation = relation,
                      my_tax_name = my_tax_name)
print(my_data)
```

You can use `lookup_tax_data` in a similar way to `parse_tax_data`, except you have to specify that your are using a taxon name (as opposed to a taxon ID or sequence ID):

```{r cache = TRUE}
obj <- lookup_tax_data(my_data, column = "my_tax_name", type = "taxon_name")
print(obj)
```

Note that the database taxon IDs are now used instead of the automatically generated taxon IDs.
You can change this with the `use_database_ids` option.
This takes much longer than reading in classifications because of all the database queries, so it is best avoided when possible.
However, only unique taxon names are queried, so how long it takes depends on the diversity of your taxa, rather than the number of instances:

```{r}
my_data <- rep("Homo sapiens", 100)
print(my_data)
```

This would take the same time as looking up a single *Homo sapiens*. 

```{r cache = TRUE}
obj <- lookup_tax_data(my_data, type = "taxon_name")
print(obj)
```

This also works with ranks of taxa besides species/genus. For example, the following data is classified by family: 

```{r}
my_tax_name <- c("Hominidae", "Felidae", "Canidae")
my_data <- data.frame(stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
                      organism = organism,
                      relation = relation,
                      my_tax_name = my_tax_name)
print(my_data)
```

It is parsed the exact same way as if it were species names: 

```{r cache = TRUE}
obj <- lookup_tax_data(my_data, column = "my_tax_name", type = "taxon_name")
print(obj)
```

You can also use a different database.
The example below uses GBIF instead of NCBI:

```{r cache = TRUE}
obj <- lookup_tax_data(my_data, column = "my_tax_name", type = "taxon_name", database = "gbif")
print(obj)
```


### Importing data with taxon IDs or sequence IDs

If you data has taxon IDs or sequence IDs, you do the same thing as when you have taxon names (described in previous section), expect set `type` to `"taxon_id"` or `"seq_id"` respectively.

For taxon IDs:

```{r cache = TRUE}
my_tax_id <- c("9606", "9683", "9612")
my_data <- data.frame(stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
                      organism = organism,
                      relation = relation,
                      my_tax_id = my_tax_id)
print(my_data)
obj <- lookup_tax_data(my_data, column = "my_tax_id", type = "taxon_id")
print(obj)
```

For sequence IDs: 

```{r cache = TRUE}
my_seq_id <- c("AC073210", "KM246623", "DQ334813")
my_data <- data.frame(stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
                      organism = organism,
                      relation = relation,
                      my_seq_id = my_seq_id)
print(my_data)
obj <- lookup_tax_data(my_data, column = "my_seq_id", type = "seq_id")
print(obj)
```

### Data embedded in complex strings

The function `extract_tax_data` is used when the input is a complex string containing taxonomic information.
It accepts all of the options of `parse_tax_data` described in the preceding sections, but it also has the `key` and `regex` options.
Like the `class_regex` and the `class_key` options described previously, a regular expression with capture groups is used to identify each piece of information you want and a corresponding "key" is used to identify what each piece of information is and how you want it named in the output.
For example, lets say we have the following data, similar to FASTA headers:

```{r}
my_data <- paste0(">org:", organism, "--rel:", relation, "--tax:", org_class)
print(my_data)
```

We need to make a regular expression that identifies where each piece of data is and a corresponding key identifying which piece is a source of taxonomic information.
In this case we can use the following settings:

```{r}
obj <- extract_tax_data(my_data, regex = ">org:(.+)--rel:(.+)--tax:(.+)",
                        key = c(organism = "info", relation = "info", org_class = "class"),
                        class_sep = ";")
print(obj)
```

The `class_key` and `class_regex` options can be used to import embedded classifications with per taxon data (e.g. rank), as was described previously for `parse_tax_data`.
This example uses classifications, but taxon names, taxon IDs, to sequence IDs can also be used.
For taxon names:

```{r cache = TRUE}
my_data <- paste0(">org:", organism, "--rel:", relation, "--tax:", my_tax_name)
print(my_data)
obj <- extract_tax_data(my_data, regex = ">org:(.+)--rel:(.+)--tax:(.+)",
                        key = c(organism = "info", relation = "info", my_tax_name = "taxon_name"),
                        class_sep = ";")
print(obj)
```

For taxon IDs:

```{r cache = TRUE}
my_data <- paste0(">org:", organism, "--rel:", relation, "--tax:", my_tax_id)
print(my_data)
obj <- extract_tax_data(my_data, regex = ">org:(.+)--rel:(.+)--tax:(.+)",
                        key = c(organism = "info", relation = "info", my_tax_id = "taxon_id"),
                        class_sep = ";")
print(obj)
```

For sequence IDs:

```{r cache = TRUE}
my_data <- paste0(">org:", organism, "--rel:", relation, "--tax:", my_seq_id)
print(my_data)
obj <- extract_tax_data(my_data, regex = ">org:(.+)--rel:(.+)--tax:(.+)",
                        key = c(organism = "info", relation = "info", my_seq_id = "seq_id"),
                        class_sep = ";")
print(obj)
```

### Parsing multiple datasets at once

So far, we have used a single input object, be it `vector`, `list`, or `data.frame`.
The `taxmap` class can support any number of data sets, so multiple vectors, lists, or tables can be imported at once.
There is always one data set that contains the taxonomic information and then other data sets that share some characteristic with it, such as a common name, order (i.e. index), or an shared identifier stored in a column.
This only works with the `parse_tax_data` and `lookup_tax_data` functions currently.

Let make a set of data sets to use. First a table with taxonomic classifications:

```{r}
species_data <- data.frame(tax = org_class,
                           my_custom_id = c("A", "B", "C"))
print(species_data)
```

Then another table with abundance data:

```{r}
abundance <- data.frame(id = c("A", "B", "C", "A", "B", "C"),
                        site_id = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2),
                        counts = c(1, 4, 3, 1, 5, 13))
print(abundance)
```

Note how this does not contain taxon data, buts does have a variable in common with `species_data` ("id" = "my_custom_id").
Here is a vector named by the same ID:

```{r}
common_names <- c(A = "Scottie", B = "Cat", C = "Dog")
```

And finally, another related data set with no names, but in the same order:

```{r}
foods <- list(c("bagels", "spaghetti squash"), # WARNING: Might not actually be what Scott eats
              c("mice", "kibble"),
              c("cats", "kibble"))
```

To parse all these at once, the main dataset with the taxonomic information is the first argument and the rest are supplied to the `datasets` option.
In addition, there must be an entry in the `mappings` option for each additional dataset.
The `mappings` option specified how each additional data set is related to the data set with the taxonomic information.
The names of the vector given to `mappings` is the common attribute of the data set with the taxonomic information and the value is the matching attribute in each additional dataset.
In addition to column names, there are some special values (e.g.. `"{{index}}"` and `"{{name}}"`) that can be used.
See `?parse_tax_data` for details.
For example, the preceding combination of data sets can be parsed like so:

```{r}
obj = parse_tax_data(species_data,
                     datasets = list(counts = abundance,
                                     my_names = common_names,
                                     foods = foods),
                     mappings = c("my_custom_id" = "id",
                                  "my_custom_id" = "{{name}}",
                                  "{{index}}" = "{{index}}"),
                     class_cols = "tax",
                     class_sep = ";")
print(obj)
```

### Using the `taxmap` constructor

Those more familiar with object oriented programing might be wondering if `taxmap` has a "constructor" (standard initialization function) for creating new objects.
It does and using it might be the best choice in some situations.
It is probably most useful when developing functions that create `taxmap` objects from specific formats.
The constructor is much less flexible than the parsing functions covered above.
The taxonomic information must take the form of either:

1. A list of `hierarchy` objects
1. A list character vectors representing taxonomic classifications

We will use character vectors for these examples, but the same ideas apply to  list of `hierarchy` objects (i.e. `hierarchies`).
Values can be given as multiple parameters:

```{r}
taxmap(c("Animalia", "Mammalia", "Carnivora", "Hominidae", "Homo", "sapiens"),
       c("Animalia", "Mammalia", "Carnivora", "Felidae", "Felis", "silvestris"),
       c("Animalia", "Mammalia", "Carnivora", "Canidae", "Canis", "lupus"))
```

Or as a list:

```{r}
taxmap(.list = list(c("Animalia", "Mammalia", "Carnivora", "Hominidae", "Homo", "sapiens"),
                    c("Animalia", "Mammalia", "Carnivora", "Felidae", "Felis", "silvestris"),
                    c("Animalia", "Mammalia", "Carnivora", "Canidae", "Canis", "lupus")))
```

Any data sets that are added at the time of initalization are assumed to associated with taxa.
If you want to add data sets not associated with data, add them after initializing with `taxmap` to avoid messages and warings.
If data sets have the same length as the input classifications, then they are assumed to be in the same order: 

```{r}
taxmap(.list = list(c("Animalia", "Mammalia", "Carnivora", "Hominidae", "Homo", "sapiens"),
                    c("Animalia", "Mammalia", "Carnivora", "Felidae", "Felis", "silvestris"),
                    c("Animalia", "Mammalia", "Carnivora", "Canidae", "Canis", "lupus")),
       data = list(x = 1:3))
```

They can also start out named by taxon IDs.
This is can be useful if taxon IDs are set to reference database IDs, rather than being generated automatically.

```{r}
taxmap(.list = list(c("Animalia", "Mammalia", "Carnivora", "Hominidae", "Homo", "sapiens"),
                    c("Animalia", "Mammalia", "Carnivora", "Felidae", "Felis", "silvestris"),
                    c("Animalia", "Mammalia", "Carnivora", "Canidae", "Canis", "lupus")),
       data = list(x = c(b = 2)))
```

The equivalent for tables requires that the table has a "taxon_id" column: 

```{r}
taxmap(.list = list(c("Animalia", "Mammalia", "Carnivora", "Hominidae", "Homo", "sapiens"),
                    c("Animalia", "Mammalia", "Carnivora", "Felidae", "Felis", "silvestris"),
                    c("Animalia", "Mammalia", "Carnivora", "Canidae", "Canis", "lupus")),
       data = list(x = data.frame(taxon_id = "b", x = 2)))
```

If instead of taxon IDs, you have which classification index each row corresponds to, add a "taxon_index" column:

```{r}
taxmap(.list = list(c("Animalia", "Mammalia", "Carnivora", "Hominidae", "Homo", "sapiens"),
                    c("Animalia", "Mammalia", "Carnivora", "Felidae", "Felis", "silvestris"),
                    c("Animalia", "Mammalia", "Carnivora", "Canidae", "Canis", "lupus")),
       data = list(x = data.frame(taxon_index = 1, x = 2)))
```
